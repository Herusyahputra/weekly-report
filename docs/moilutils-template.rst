MoilUtils Template

Structure Development Apps
==========================

Before developing an application using the moilutils-template, it is beneficial to have a clear understanding of the concept
behind the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model that is applied in the development of this application. This understanding will facilitate the development process and make it easier to build the application.

Design User Interface
======================

First, we create a user interface design using PyQt6 Design to meet specific needs and desired style. For this particular design,
for the example. I have created a simple yet versatile user interface that incorporates methods for fisheye camera implementation.

.. figure:: assets/
   :scale: 80 %

   Result design user interface

following this command to convert ui file to python file

.. figure:: assets/
   :scale: 80 %
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center

   Result design user interface

Developing using PyCharm
=========================

The directory structure in the tree directory reflects the implementation of the MVC model and promotes efficient understanding, modification, and advanced development.
If you take a closer look, you will notice the "docs" folder, which provides tutorials and documentation to assist you in developing applications using the moilutils-template. This folder serves as a valuable resource for guidance and reference throughout the development process.
